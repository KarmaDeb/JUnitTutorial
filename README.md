# JUnit in bukkit

This is the source code used in the tutorial on how to perform unit testing in
bukkit. The source code uses gradle and the latest version of [MockBukkit](https://github.com/MockBukkit/MockBukkit) (04/06/2024),
which supports only bukkit 1.20.

In order to mock in this version of MockBukkit, using paper API is requested, my recommendation if
you want to use only spigot API, use spigot API for your plugin, but use paper API for your tests
